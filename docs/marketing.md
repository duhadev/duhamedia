# Marketing guide — duhamedia.com

**How to use this doc:** check the Quick reference table first for everyday tasks; for anything else, find the page in the table of contents and read what you can change there and exactly where to click.

This guide is written for someone who is not a developer. Everything you can edit lives in the **admin** — the website's back office at `duhamedia.com/admin`. A few words you will see:

- **Block** — one section of a page (for example a hero banner, a testimonial row or a sign-up form). Pages are built by stacking blocks; you can edit what each block says and shows.
- **Draft / Publish** — changes are saved as a draft first. Visitors only see a change after it is **published**. Publishing is always done by a person, never automatically.
- **Slug** — the last part of a page's web address (in `duhamedia.com/about`, the slug is `about`).

Sections are added here as each part of the site is finished and approved.

## Admin basics (site-wide)

These parts of the admin are not tied to one page. They are the accounts people log in with, and the libraries of images and files the pages use. A **collection** is one list of things in the admin (for example all users, or all images). Collections are listed in the left-hand menu under **Collections**.

### Users and roles

**SEO:** n/a.

**Editable by marketing**
- Every account has a **role**, which decides what that person (or program) can do:
  - **Admin**: can do everything, including creating users and changing roles.
  - **Marketing**: edits website content. Can only see and edit **their own** account (name, email, password). Cannot see other users, cannot create or delete users, and cannot change anyone's role, including their own.
  - **Pipeline (API key only)**: not a person. It is the automated article writer (the "content pipeline"). It cannot log in to the admin at all. It connects with an **API key** (a long secret code that acts as its password) and can only create **drafts** of articles. It can never publish. A person always reviews and publishes.
- **Edit your own account:** **Admin → Collections → Users → (your account)**, change your name, email or password, then **Save**.
- **Only an Admin can create, remove or change users.** If you need a new colleague added, or someone's role changed, ask an Admin.

**Forms & leads:** n/a.

**Social share:** n/a.

**Other**
- **Lockout:** after **5 wrong passwords in a row**, the account is locked for **10 minutes**. Either wait 10 minutes and try again, or ask an Admin to open **Admin → Collections → Users → (the locked person) → Force Unlock**.
- **For Admins: giving the pipeline its key.**
  1. **Admin → Collections → Users → Create New**.
  2. Fill in an email and password (the password is never used, because a Pipeline user cannot log in), and set **Role** (in the right-hand sidebar) to **Pipeline (API key only)**.
  3. **Save first.** The API key option does not appear until the user has been saved as Pipeline.
  4. Back in that user's page, tick **Enable API Key**, click **Generate new API key**, then **Save**.
  5. Copy the key straight away and hand it over securely. Treat it like a password: never paste it into an email, chat or document.
- **Changing a Pipeline user to any other role cancels its key immediately.** Only Pipeline users can have a key; the admin refuses one on an Admin or Marketing account.

### Media library (images)

**SEO**
- Every image has **Alt text** ("alternative text"): a short description of what the image shows. Screen readers read it aloud to blind visitors, and search engines use it to understand the image. It is **required**, and the admin rejects an empty one or one that looks like a file name (for example `IMG_0042.JPG`).
- Good: "Founder at a whiteboard mapping a store launch". Bad: "image", "photo1.png".
- Edit it at **Admin → Collections → Media → (image) → Alt**, then **Save**. The change applies everywhere that image is used.

**Editable by marketing**
- **Add an image:** **Admin → Collections → Media → Create New** → choose or drag in the file → write the **Alt** text → optionally a **Caption** → **Save**.
- Accepted types: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF and SVG.
- **Caption** (optional): a default caption shown under the image when it is used as a figure inside an article.
- **Focal point:** after choosing the file, you can click the part of the image that matters most (a face, a product). When the site crops the image to fit a card or banner, it keeps that point in frame. The focal-point tool only appears on desktop-width screens, not on a phone.
- **Replace or remove:** open the image in **Admin → Collections → Media**, then edit or delete it. Before deleting, check the image is not still used on a page, or that spot will lose its picture.
- Sizes are made automatically when you upload: a small admin thumbnail, card, wide and full-width versions, and a **1200 × 630** version used when a page is shared on social media. You never resize images yourself.

**Forms & leads:** n/a.

**Social share:** the 1200 × 630 share size is generated from every uploaded image. Where you choose the default share image is covered under [Site-wide settings](#site-wide-settings) once that part is built.

**Other**
- Images have no draft stage: once saved, the file is live at a public web address. Only upload images that are fine for anyone to see.
- PDFs and other files do not go here; they go in [Downloads](#downloads-lead-magnet-files).

### Downloads (lead-magnet files)

A **lead magnet** is a free resource (a guide, checklist or worksheet) that visitors get in exchange for their email address. The files themselves live here.

**SEO:** n/a.

**Editable by marketing**
- **Add a file:** **Admin → Collections → Downloads → Create New** → choose the file → give it a **Title** (required) → **Save**.
- The **Title** is what you see in the admin and is used as the link text in the email that delivers the file.
- Accepted types: PDF, CSV, Excel (`.xlsx` only, not the older `.xls`) and ZIP.
- **Replace or remove:** open the file in **Admin → Collections → Downloads**, then edit or delete it.

**Forms & leads:** n/a here. The capture form that sends this file is covered under [Lead Magnet template](#18-lead-magnet-template) once that part is built.

**Social share:** n/a.

**Other**
- Each file gets a **public web link**: anyone with the link can download it. Never upload anything confidential.
